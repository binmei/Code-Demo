                Math Fun 1000 is a math program that will help students become better at math and teachers become better at teaching math.
                <br/><br/> Some of the key features that this program will offer is allow students to scroll, click, hover, type, and get immediate feedback on the problem they are working on. Every step used to solve the problem will be shown and the program will not assume that you know a step or formula. 
                <br/><br/>Students will be able to scroll through multiple examples similar to their problem. They student can always move back and forth threw the different types of examples; fill in the blank, and step by step instructions. This will allow the student to learn at their pace instead of a set pace, the can go in and out of examples that are centered on the type of problem they are trying to figure out.
                <br/><br/>This will not be hooked to a math book, but instead teacher driven as the teacher of the class will put in problems they see fit as examples.</p>
